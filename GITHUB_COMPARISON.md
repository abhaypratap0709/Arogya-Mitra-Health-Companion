# GitHub vs Local Project Comparison

**GitHub repo:** [abhaypratap0709/Arogya-Mitra-Health-Companion](https://github.com/abhaypratap0709/Arogya-Mitra-Health-Companion)

## Layout difference

| | GitHub | This project (local) |
|---|--------|----------------------|
| **Structure** | Flat – app files at repo **root** | Nested – app files inside **AIStudyCoach/** |
| **Run command** | `streamlit run app.py` (from repo root) | `streamlit run app.py` (from **AIStudyCoach/**) |

---

## Files on GitHub that were missing locally

| File / folder | Action taken |
|---------------|--------------|
| `admin_access.py` | Added to **AIStudyCoach/** (direct admin portal entry) |
| `attached_assets/` | Added as empty folder under **AIStudyCoach/** |
| `pyproject.toml` | Added to **AIStudyCoach/** (project metadata) |

`uv.lock` on GitHub is generated by the `uv` tool; you can create it with `uv lock` if you use `uv`.

---

## Files only in this project (not on GitHub)

These are **local-only** and extend the base repo:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `AIStudyCoach/db_router.py` | Chooses MySQL vs SQLite backend |
| `AIStudyCoach/mysql_manager.py` | MySQL with connection pooling |
| `AIStudyCoach/risk_scoring.py` | Worker intake risk scoring |
| `AIStudyCoach/speech_notes.py` | Faster-Whisper speech-to-text |
| `AIStudyCoach/summarizer.py` | Gemini clinical note summarization |
| `AIStudyCoach/BUGS_AND_ISSUES.md` | Notes / docs |
| `AIStudyCoach/IMPROVEMENT_SUGGESTIONS.md` | Notes / docs |
| `AIStudyCoach/UNUSED_FILES_ANALYSIS.md` | Notes / docs |

---

## requirements.txt

| | GitHub | This project |
|---|--------|--------------|
| **Location** | Repo root | **AIStudyCoach/requirements.txt** |
| **Content** | Shorter list (Streamlit, Plotly, pandas, pytesseract, googletrans, folium, etc.) | Superset: same + `mysql-connector-python`, `faster-whisper`, `jiwer`, `google-generativeai`, `qrcode`, `python-dotenv`, `httpcore`, `httpx` |

Use **AIStudyCoach/requirements.txt** for this project; it includes everything the app needs (MySQL, Whisper, Gemini, etc.).

---

## Summary

- **Core app files** (app.py, admin_portal.py, database.py, emergency_sos.py, health_chatbot.py, health_dashboard.py, indian_states_cities.py, ocr_analyzer.py, translator.py, utils.py, .streamlit, README.md, arogya_mitra.db) are present in both; locally they live under **AIStudyCoach/**.
- **Added to match GitHub:** `admin_access.py`, `attached_assets/`, `pyproject.toml` under **AIStudyCoach/**.
- **Only in this project:** db_router, mysql_manager, risk_scoring, speech_notes, summarizer, and the extra .md docs; these are intentional extensions.
- To run: `cd AIStudyCoach` then `streamlit run app.py` (or `streamlit run admin_access.py` for admin-only).
